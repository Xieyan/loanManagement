Overview
-------
Loanmanagement is a web application system which designed for managers and viewers to do the loan review. Four parts are designed for this system: login page, admin dashboard, manager dashboard and viewerdashboard. Our system can provide an online platform for managers who have lots of forms to be reviewed and viewers who need to check those infomation to work together. When loan forms come into our system, the administrator would transform the raw data to formal data and assign this form to certain managers. Then the manager is able to assign sections which concluded inside the form to different viewers. Viewers can see their tasks with viewer dashboard and write comments and give feedbacks to manager. There could be several steps for them to communicate. Finally, they can work together to finish loan reviews.
