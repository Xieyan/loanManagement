# loanManagement
=========

Overview
----------
Companies are frequently inundated with loan forms from banks. These loan forms have to be checked by different companies and departments and subsequently assigned to their respective staff. Our purpose is to build a platform to facilitate the process that companies and departments go through during loan management to improve existing workflow.</br> </br>
LoanManagement is a web application system designed for managers and viewers to perform loan management. It is  an integrated online platform for managers to review loan forms and for staff to verify loan information. There are four key aspects in LoanManagement: (1) Login page, (2) Admin dashboard, (3) Manager dashboard and (4) Viewer dashboard. </br> When LoanManagement receives loan forms, an administrator would be able to view and preprocess the data and later assign the loan forms to respective managers. Following which, managers could assign different sections of the loan form to different staff. Staff would be able to view their task(s) and provide feedback to managers. Managers are also able to reply to the feedback. Once all sections of the loan forms have been verified, managers could aggregate staff feedback to decide on the status of the loan form.
