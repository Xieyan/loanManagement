# loanManagement
=========

Overview
----------
Scenario is like the loan system generates a lot of loan forms. Then all the loan forms need to checked by different companys and departments. So the managers in certain company and department can assign those tasks to his/her staff viewers. Our purpose is to build a platform to facilitate managers and viewers review process.</br> 
Loanmanagement is a web application system which designed for managers and viewers to do the loan review. Four parts are designed for this system: login page, admin dashboard, manager dashboard and viewer dashboard. Our system can provide an online platform for managers who have lots of forms to be reviewed and viewers who have to check those infomation to work together. When loan forms come into our system, the administrator would transform the raw data to formal data and assign this form to certain managers. Then the manager would be able to assign sections which concluded inside the form to different viewers. Viewers would be able to see their tasks with viewer dashboard and write comments and give feedbacks to managers. Acturally, there could be several steps for them to iterate the communication process. Finally, managers would be able to combine all the feedbacks from his staff viewers to make a decision about the form status.
